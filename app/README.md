# Exposure Essence

The frontend is built using Nextjs and is currently just a simple placeholder for similar projects.

We have a homepage with some basic menu options, a contact form, and a custom tile gallery. The full version
is a WIP and will include custom payment options for various shoots that my client has. This will integrate with 
a connected Stripe account.
